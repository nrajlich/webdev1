<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<p>In this example, x, y, and z walk into a bar...</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"x says, 'I'm feeling like " + x + " today!' " + 
"y replies, 'Well, I'm " + y + ", always one step ahead.' " +
"z laughs and says, 'Relax, you two! Together we are " + z + ", and that iss what counts!'";

</script>

<p>In this example, <code>let</code> is used to declare variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>let</code> keyword means these variables can be reassigned later if needed.</p>

<p id="demo2"></p>

<script>
let x = 5; // x starts with the value 5
let y = 6; // y starts with the value 6
let z = x + y; // z is calculated as the sum of x and y
document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =
"x is: " + x + ", y is: " + y + ", and z (x + y) is: " + z +
". These values can be updated because they are declared with let.";

<h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

<p>In this example, <code>const</code> is used to declare variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>const</code> keyword means these variables are constants and cannot be reassigned after their initial declaration.</p>

<p id="demo3"></p>

<script>
const d = 5; // x is a constant with the value 5
const e = 6; // y is a constant with the value 6
const f = d + f; // z is calculated as the sum of x and y and is also a constant
document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML =
"x is: " + x + ", y is: " + y + ", and z (x + y) is: " + z +
". These values cannot be changed because they are declared with const.";
